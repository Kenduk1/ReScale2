			<h2>Version 1.0.5</h2>
			<p><small>December 25, 2022</small></p>

			<p>Merry Christmas to everyone using Re:Scale 2 out there! As for day 2 of "3 Days of Christmas - 3 Presents", Re:Scale 2 has finally been updated to include all device resolutions up to iPhone 14 Pro (Max), as well as new status bar compatibility options. Enjoy!</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Added Activator action to quickly reset the resolution and status bar to default (recommended to set <i>before</i> setting a resolution)</li>
				<li>This update also brings back the 30 second timeout for automatically resetting the resolution in case of a black screen. And this time it should actually work.</li>
				<li>Updated available screen resolutions and status bars up to iOS 16 (maybe setting the status bar to "Dynamic Island" will actually enable the Dynamic Island on pre-iPhone 14 Pro devices running iOS 16)</li>
				<li>Added "What's New" to Re:Scale preferences</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Version 1.0.4-2</h2>
			<p><small>April 30, 2021</small></p>

			<ul>
				<li>Fixed lockscreen timeout once and for all</li>
				<li>Hopefully improved battery usage</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Version 1.0.4</h2>
			<p><small>April 27, 2021</small></p>

			<ul>
				<li>Fixed crashes on iOS 9-12 because I took some code from LockWatch, thinking it would just work on anything older than iOS 13. <i>Sometimes my stupidity is almost frightening.</i> <sup>That's a Top Gear reference, by the way</sup><br>For this, I had to increase the minimum iOS requirement to iOS 9, which shouldn't be too much of a problem, since iPhone 4s and iPad 2 both support iOS 9.</li>
			</ul>

		<article class="markdown-body">
			<h2>Version 1.0.3</h2>
			<p><small>April 27, 2021</small></p>

			<ul>
				<li>Added automatic reset dialog: If you select an unsupported resolution and your screen goes black, just wait 30 seconds and the resolution will be reset to default (thanks to /u/Prosoch for this suggestion!)</li>
				<li>More localization improvements</li>
			</ul>
		</article>

		<article class="markdown-body">

			<h2>Version 1.0.1</h2>
			<p><small>April 24, 2021</small></p>

			<ul>
				<li>Fixed keyboard layout on iPhone when using unsupported resolutions (literally any resolution that's larger than stock)</li>
				<li>Fixed resolution values not being copied correctly when setting a custom resolution (eg. 1240x0@3x)</li>
				<li>Added support for saving custom resolutions</li>
				<li>Added a button to reset the current resolution to default</li>
				<li>Added an option to reverse resolutions (height x width) on iPad</li>
